## The One API Data Retrieval and Filtering

This project uses The One API to retrieve data on characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's universe. The `first_api_script.py` script fetches character details and filters specific fields, such as name, race, gender, and realm, displaying a clean, structured output. This project demonstrates basic API interaction, data filtering, and output formatting for a specified dataset.
